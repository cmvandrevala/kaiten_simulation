Kaiten Simulation
=================

Background
----------

In the anime Naruto, Hyuga Neji has an ultimate technique where he rotates very quickly while releasing a large amount of chakra.  This causes  a spherical vortex that can deflect pretty much any attack.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xotUq5VzEts) is an example of what kaiten looks like in the Naruto anime.

Question
-------- 

How fast would Hyuga Neji have to be rotating in order to deflect an actual projectile?

Assumptions
-----------

* Chakra is essentially massless
* The air around Neji becomes imbued with chakra and rotates quickly
* This rotating air can be modeled as a vector field
